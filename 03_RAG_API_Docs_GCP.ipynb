        "RAG architectures enhance large language models (LLMs) by providing them with external, relevant information before generating a response. Instead of solely relying on their pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems first retrieve pertinent data from a knowledge base, typically a vector database, based on the user's query. This retrieved context is then fed to the LLM alongside the original query, enabling the model to produce more accurate, factual, and up-to-date answers. This process helps to mitigate common LLM limitations like hallucinations and outdated information, grounding the generated content in verifiable sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of RAG are **Vector databases** and embeddings. It is a specialized database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors, known as embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that handle structured data or documents directly, vector databases excel at finding vectors that are semantically similar to a given query vector. This efficiency in similarity search is vital for RAG, allowing for quick identification of relevant documents from a vast collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Embeddings** themselves are numerical representations of data (like text, images, or audio) in a multi-dimensional space. These representations are created by machine learning models, where the semantic meaning of the data is encoded by the proximity of their vectors in that space. For instance, pieces of text with similar meanings will have embedding vectors that are closer together, enabling computers to understand and compare content based on its semantic context.\n",

        "    <summary>This paper presents NT-Java-1.1B, an open-source specialized code language model built on StarCoderBase-1.1B, designed for coding tasks in Java programming. NT-Java-1.1B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing its base model and majority of other models of similar size on MultiPL-E Java code benchmark. While there have been studies on extending large, generic pre-trained models to improve proficiency in specific programming languages like Python, similar investigations on small code models for other programming languages are lacking. Large code models require specialized hardware like GPUs for inference, highlighting the need for research into building small code models that can be deployed on developer desktops. This paper addresses this research gap by focusing on the development of a small Java code model, NT-Java-1.1B, and its quantized versions, which performs comparably to open models around 1.1B on MultiPL-E Java code benchmarks, making them ideal for desktop deployment. This paper establishes the foundation for specialized models across languages and sizes for a family of NT Models.</summary>\n",

            "This paper provides a valuable initial analysis of how price shocks affect farmer welfare in East Java, utilizing a robust BVAR methodology. Building upon these findings, future research could delve deeper and broaden the scope in several directions:\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some potential future work avenues:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Disaggregation and Specificity of Shocks:**\n",
            "    *   **Commodity-Specific Analysis:** Instead of aggregate food prices, analyze the impact of price fluctuations for specific key commodities (e.g., rice, corn, palm oil, specific vegetables) that are dominant in East Java. The impact of a rice price shock might differ significantly from a vegetable price shock.\n",
            "    *   **Disaggregated Inflation Components:** Investigate which components of inflation (e.g., food, energy, housing) have the most significant negative impact on farmer exchange values. This could reveal more targeted policy intervention points.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Inclusion of Input Costs and Other Variables:**\n",
            "    *   **Farmer Input Prices:** The current study focuses on output prices and general inflation. Future work should explicitly incorporate the prices of key agricultural inputs (fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, fuel, labor wages) into the model. An increase in food prices might increase FEV, but if input costs rise even faster, the net effect on well-being could still be negative.\n",
            "    *   **Climate and Weather Variables:** Agriculture is highly susceptible to weather shocks. Including variables for rainfall, temperature anomalies, or extreme weather events could provide a more comprehensive understanding of factors influencing both prices and farmer welfare.\n",
            "    *   **Government Policies and Subsidies:** Analyze the buffering effect or exacerbating role of government policies like price stabilization, input subsidies, or credit programs on farmer welfare amidst price and inflation shocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Exploring Causal Mechanisms and Heterogeneity:**\n",
            "    *   **Understanding the \"Positive Food Price Shock\" Effect:** The finding that aggregate food price shocks *increase* FEV is intriguing. Future research could explore the underlying mechanisms more deeply. Is it due to market power dynamics, farmers being net sellers of food, or slow transmission of food price increases to other consumer goods relevant to farmers' expenditures?\n",
            "    *   **Farmer Heterogeneity:** Not all farmers are the same. Future work could investigate if the impact of price and inflation shocks varies based on:\n",
            "        *   Farm size (smallholder vs. large-scale)\n",
            "        *   Type of farming (subsistence vs. commercial)\n",
            "        *   Crop diversity\n",
            "        *   Access to markets, credit, and information\n",
            "        *   Geographic location within East Java (e.g., coastal vs. mountainous regions)\n",
            "        This would likely require micro-level or panel data, moving beyond aggregated time series.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Methodological Extensions:**\n",
            "    *   **Structural VAR (SVAR) Models:** To better identify and distinguish between demand-side and supply-side shocks to food prices, and to impose more theoretical restrictions on the relationships.\n",
            "    *   **Non-linear Models:** Investigate if the responses are asymmetric or non-linear. For example, a large price increase might have a different impact on FEV than a small one, or farmers might react differently to price increases vs. decreases. (e.g., Threshold VAR, Regime-Switching VAR).\n",
            "    *   **Forecasting and Policy Simulation:** Use the enhanced model to forecast future FEV and food prices, and to simulate the potential impact of various policy interventions (e.g., different levels of subsidies, price floors/ceilings) on farmer welfare.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Broader Measures of Farmer Well-being:**\n",
            "    *   **Multi-dimensional Well-being:** While FEV is a good economic indicator, \"well-being\" is multi-faceted. Future work could integrate other indicators such as food security levels, health outcomes, access to education, or even subjective well-being measures through household surveys.\n",
            "    *   **Link to Poverty and Income Inequality:** Analyze how price uncertainty and inflation disproportionately affect different income strata among farmers and its implications for rural poverty and inequality in East Java.\n",
            "\n",
            "By pursuing these avenues, future research can build a more nuanced, comprehensive, and policy-relevant understanding of the challenges faced by farmers in East Java and contribute to more effective strategies for enhancing their well-being.\n"

        "    <summary>This paper presents NT-Java-1.1B, an open-source specialized code language model built on StarCoderBase-1.1B, designed for coding tasks in Java programming. NT-Java-1.1B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing its base model and majority of other models of similar size on MultiPL-E Java code benchmark. While there have been studies on extending large, generic pre-trained models to improve proficiency in specific programming languages like Python, similar investigations on small code models for other programming languages are lacking. Large code models require specialized hardware like GPUs for inference, highlighting the need for research into building small code models that can be deployed on developer desktops. This paper addresses this research gap by focusing on the development of a small Java code model, NT-Java-1.1B, and its quantized versions, which performs comparably to open models around 1.1B on MultiPL-E Java code benchmarks, making them ideal for desktop deployment. This paper establishes the foundation for specialized models across languages and sizes for a family of NT Models.</summary>\n",
