A cornerstone of modern NLP is the use of **embeddings**, which are numerical representations of words or phrases that capture their semantic meaning, allowing algorithms to process linguistic data effectively. Building upon these foundations, **Large Language Models (LLMs)** represent a significant advancement, utilizing vast datasets and sophisticated architectures to understand context, generate coherent text, and perform a wide array of language-based tasks."

        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a highly advanced class of generative AI models built upon the principles of **Deep Learning**. They primarily utilize sophisticated **neural networks**, which are computational architectures inspired by the human brain, characterized by multiple layers that enable them to learn complex patterns from data. The most prevalent architecture within LLMs today is the **transformer** model, which excels at processing sequential data like text by employing attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input. This combination allows LLMs to process vast amounts of text, understand context, and generate human-like language for a wide array of tasks, from translation and summarization to creative writing and question answering.\n",
